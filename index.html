                <div class="text"> 
                  I am a rising senior at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering 
                  with a minor in User Experience Design in the School of Information. I am from Cincinnati, Ohio and 
                  attended high school at Ursuline Academy. Raised a wolverine in enemy territory, it has been a dream to 
                  be able to attend one of the top public institutions in the nation.

                <div class="title">Why computer science?</div>
                <div class="text"> 
                  I intially chose computer science because of the creativity of the field. 
                  I took an introductory class in high school dedicated to app developement 
                  and fell in love with the idea of constantly being able to innovate and 
                  enhance the features of an application I created. As a student at the University of 
                  Michigan, I have been exposed to a much more technical side of computer science. 
                  Just as I fell in love with computer science for its creativity, I also enjoy it 
                  for its emphasis on problem solving and the thrill of finally fixing a bug in my program.

                <div class="title">What am I passionate about?</div>
                <div class="text"> My newest passion is finding new passions. 
                  The most recent hobby I have been exploring is crocheting, and I am excited to start 
                  piano lessons when I return to Michigan in the fall. I also enjoy spending time outdoors whether 
                  that be through hiking, swimming, or playing sports. In my professional life,
                  I am passionate about using my talent and skills in order to make a positive difference in the world.

                  facilitating social expansion, driving technological progress, and providing academic support. Our commitment to these principles is evident through our engagement in project teams, study groups, professional development workshops, and hackathons/design jams. 
                  Within KTP, I have participated in the ethical, mobile, 
                  and design committees as well as been part of the team that created a mobile application to streamline the rush process.

                  I have been part of the Michigan Daily web developement team for one semester. 
                  In that time I worked on creating a new page under the style guide. 
                  The style guide is an internal site that can be utilized by designers on the 
                  Michigan Daily team in order to download and reference standard font styles, colors, and formats. 
                  I worked specifically on creating the page with fonts so that designers can see different fonts 
                  utilized on the Daily. To create this webpage, I was first given a Figma page which I then recreated
                  using HTML, CSS, and React elements.

                  This workshop was strategically crafted to captivate their curiosity and kindle an early fascination with the world of technology. 
                  Through interactive activities, hands-on experiences, and engaging discussions, participants were introduced to the captivating possibilities within the technology sector.
                  By cultivating an environment of creativity and empowerment, Miss STEMS Careers is shaping the future by inspiring the next generation of female technology leaders.
