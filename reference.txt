                      I have been part of the Michigan Daily web developement team for one semester. 
                      In that time I worked on creating a new page under the style guide. 
                      The style guide is an internal site that can be utilized by designers on the 
                      Michigan Daily team in order to download and reference standard font styles, colors, and formats. 
                      I worked specifically on creating the page with fonts so that designers can see different fonts 
                      utilized on the Daily. To create this webpage, I was first given a Figma page which I then recreated
                      using HTML, CSS, and React elements.

                      Kappa Theta Pi is Michigan's premier professional technology fraternity with members across various disciplines united by a fervor for technology. 
                      Our fraternity's core revolves around five essential pillars: fostering professional growth, nurturing alumni connections, 
                      facilitating social expansion, driving technological progress, and providing academic support. Our commitment to these principles is evident through our engagement in project teams, study groups, professional development workshops, and hackathons/design jams. 
                      This dynamic culture of growth empowers our members to explore tech-related passions while benefiting from steadfast support and encouragement.
                      Within the organization, I have participated in the ethical, mobile, 
                      and design committees as well as been part of the team that created a mobile application to streamline the rush process.

                      As part of our efforts, I led the design and execution of a dynamic computer science workshop tailored specifically for middle school girls. 
                      This workshop was strategically crafted to captivate their curiosity and kindle an early fascination with the world of technology.
